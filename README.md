# CUB3D-2021
The project cub3D is about raycasting. The aim is to create a map and be able to move inside the map like in a FPS. In a configuration file (map.cub) the user must be able to change the textures on the different walls, the colors of the floor and ceiling (in RGB), the map and where you land in the map at first. I did my cub3D in September 2021.
