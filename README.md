# CUB3D-2021
Cub3D graded 105 by my peers on September 14, 2021 with the norm 3.3.32. The minilibx and its flags in the makefile are configured to work on LINUX. 

In this repo, you will find :
- SUBJECT-cub3d-en.pdf : the subject in english
- FINAL-cub3d : where all the code is

To launch, run `cd FINAL-CUB3D` then `make && ./cub3D map.cub` (in a Linux environement). The config file for the map is called map.cub. Feel free to change the map, the floor (F) and ceiling (C)'s color, the texture's path (NO, SO, EA, WE) (in xpm format).
